# FriendFinder

<p>Compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a simple survey, then compare their answers with those from existing users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.</p>

<p>You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out</p>
